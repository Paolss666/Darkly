# Path Traversal Vulnerability

![Exploit Screenshot](<Screenshot from 2025-11-01 12-21-52.png>)

## Overview

A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. 

It should be noted that access to files is limited by system operational access control (such as in the case of locked or in-use files on the Microsoft Windows operating system).

This attack is also known as:
- **"dot-dot-slash"**
- **"directory traversal"**
- **"directory climbing"**
- **"backtracking"**

## Exploitation

## How to Avoid Path Traversal Vulnerabilities

All but the most simple web applications have to include local resources, such as images, themes, other scripts, and so on. Every time a resource or file is included by the application, there is a risk that an attacker may be able to include a file or remote resource you didn't authorize.

### How to Identify if You Are Vulnerable

1. **Understand the Operating System Behavior**
   - Be sure you understand how the underlying operating system will process filenames handed off to it
   - Different OS handle path separators and special characters differently

2. **Secure File Storage**
   - Don't store sensitive configuration files inside the web root
   - Keep credentials, API keys, and sensitive data outside publicly accessible directories

3. **Windows IIS Servers Specific**
   - The web root should not be on the system disk, to prevent recursive traversal back to system directories

## Related Security Activities

- Input validation and sanitization
- Whitelist-based file access control
- Use of secure coding frameworks
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
